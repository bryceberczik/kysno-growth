You are building a complete landing page for a company called Kysno, built in React + TailwindCSS.
The site must look clean, modern, and high-trust, similar to a minimalist SaaS or B2B growth agency.

Build a single landing page component called LandingPage.jsx.

The page must communicate clearly what Kysno does: a growth agency that helps businesses scale through customer acquisition, marketing management, retention, and revenue optimization.

Brand Overview

Kysno is a business-to-business growth agency.
The service offering:

Customer acquisition (paid ads, social media, SEO basics)

Lead generation systems

Customer retention and lifecycle management

Revenue optimization (strategy, funnels, basic automation)

Monthly growth management and reporting

Kysno’s tone: premium, clean, minimal, sophisticated, like a boutique performance agency.

Avoid childish colors or illustrations.
Use clean, wide spacing and good typography.
